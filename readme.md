# Honey Website

Welcome to the **Honey Website** repository! üçØ

## About

This project is a modern React + Vite website concept for a honey-based shop.

**This is a purely front-end website**‚Äîthere is no backend or database. All content, layout, and interactivity are handled on the client side using React components.  
The design is ideal for a honey-themed restaurant, food-product pages, or similar culinary/product-based sites.
